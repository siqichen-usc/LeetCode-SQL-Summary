-- Solution 1: CASE WHEN
SELECT LEFT(trans_date,7) AS month, country,
    COUNT(id) AS trans_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approved_count,
    SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY LEFT(trans_date,7), country;



-- Solution 2: CASE WHEN
-- Using FORMAT to increase stability
SELECT FORMAT(trans_date,'yyyy-MM') AS month, country,
    COUNT(id) AS trans_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approved_count,
    SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY FORMAT(trans_date,'yyyy-MM'), country;
